### 题目

给定一个包含 n 个整数的数组 nums, 判断 nums 中是否存在三个元素 a, b, c, 使得 a + b + c = 0? 找出所有满足条件且不重复的三元组。

注意：答案中`不可以包含重复的三元组`。

```js
例如, 给定数组 nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]，

满足要求的三元组集合为：
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```

### 解题

1. 排序;
2. 双指针;

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var threeSum = function (nums) {
  const sortNums = nums.sort((r1, r2) => r1 - r2)
  let targetValue
  let x
  let y
  const cacheObj = {}
  const result = []
  const targetCache = {}

  for (let i = 0; i < sortNums.length - 2; i++) {
    targetValue = -sortNums[i]
    x = i + 1
    y = sortNums.length - 1

    while (x < y) {
      let tmpArr = []
      if (sortNums[x] + sortNums[y] === targetValue && !cacheObj[`${-targetValue}${sortNums[x]}${sortNums[y]}`]) {
        tmpArr.push(-targetValue)
        tmpArr.push(sortNums[x])
        tmpArr.push(sortNums[y])
        result.push(tmpArr)
        cacheObj[`${-targetValue}${sortNums[x]}${sortNums[y]}`] = true
        x++
        y--
        continue
      } else if (sortNums[x] + sortNums[y] === targetValue && cacheObj[`${-targetValue}${sortNums[x]}${sortNums[y]}`]) {
        x++
        continue
      }

      if (sortNums[x] + sortNums[y] > targetValue) {
        y--
        continue
      }

      if (sortNums[x] + sortNums[y] < targetValue) {
        x++
        continue
      }
    }
  }

  return result
};
```
