### LOOK UP CSS SPECIFICATIONS IN MDN

There are three status in specifications as follows:

* `WD`: Working Draft
* `CR`: Candidate Recommendation
* `REC`: Recommendation

We can know about some detailed informations from the blue area.

* `Initial value`: The initial value of a CSS property is its default value.
* `Applies to`
* `Inherited`
* `Media`
* `Computed value`
* `Animation type`
* `Canonical order`

Now I'll show about some details about them.

### Initial value

The Initial value has two different behavious between `inherited properties` and `non-inherited properties`.

For inherited properties, the initial value is used on the root element only.

For non-inherited properties, the initial value is used on all elements.
