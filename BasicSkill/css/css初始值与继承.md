### HOW TO LOOK UP Specifications IN MDN

There are three status in specifications as follows:

* `WD`: Working Draft
* `CR`: Candidate Recommendation
* `REC`: Recommendation

from the blue area, we can know about these informations.

* `Initial value`
* `Applies to`
* `Inherited`
* `Media`
* `Computed value`
* `Animation type`
* `Canonical order`

now I'll show about some details about them.
